\title{Displays the results of an \eqn{E_n}-test for two values with
extended uncertainties}
\usage{
fct_entest_recuno(data, response, uncertainty, refvalue, refuncertainty)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a \code{data.frame} or \code{data.table} with the results
relevant for testing. Two \code{numeric} vectors with the measurements
values and their uncertainties should be included.}

\item{response}{the name of a numeric vector in \code{data}.
Quotation (" ") is not required.}

\item{uncertainty}{the name of a numeric vector in \code{data}.
Quotation (" ") is not required.}

\item{refvalue}{a \code{numeric} reference value.}

\item{refuncertainty}{the \code{numeric} uncertainty of the reference value.}
}
\value{
A list with the following items:
 \describe{
   \item{hypotheses}{a named vector of strings, being \code{h0} and \code{h1}
   the null and alternative hypothesis, respectively.}
   \item{difference}{a named vector of numbers, being \code{mean},
   \code{lwrci} and \code{uprci} the mean, lower and upper ends of the
   confidence interval for the difference of the two values, respectively.
   The confidence interval is calculated considered the combined extended
   uncertainties of the two values.}
   \item{test}{a named vector of numbers, being \code{entest} and
   \code{ecritical} the value of the test statistic and the associated critical
   value, respectively.}
   \item{result}{a string indicating whether H0 should be rejected or not.}
 }
}
\description{
The function displays the results of a \eqn{E_n}-test for two
values with extended uncertainty.
 The returned text is suitable for the {SI precisa} {shiny} app.
}
\details{
\eqn{E_n}-test is calculated with the following equation:
\deqn{E_n = \frac{|x - y|}{\sqrt{U(x)^2 + U(y)^2}}}
for \eqn{E_n \leq 1}, the difference of the two values \eqn{x} and \eqn{y} is
accounted by their extended uncertainties (\eqn{U}) and the null hypothesis is
not rejected. When \eqn{E_n > 1} the two values are different and the null
hypothesis is rejected.
