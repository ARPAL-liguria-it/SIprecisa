ggboxplot_2samples_par(data, group, response, udm, group2, dfsummary)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{input data.frame with a column named *key* with progressive integers,

summary has been provided.}

\item{dfsummary}{a data.frame with mean, sd and number of values for the two
groups: it has three rows and three columns. Column names are "index",
